I collaborated with the graphic designer to consolidate design elements and create a interactive guide using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was beneficial for designers so they could preview their designs in a real environment which helped reduce back-and-forth between dev and design. Developers could inspect the code to retrieve HTML structure or CSS styling to apply to the site an no longer had to guess hex codes or font sizes. Next I plugged in the style guide to the site; upgrading and consolidating HTML and CSS to make our site faster and more efficient.",
